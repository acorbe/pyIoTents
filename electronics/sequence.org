  - black jumpers 1+1, all different
  - yellow 1+1, equal
  - orange 1+1 (maybe a trace)


- Under
  - trace L/C3->D3 R/O3->P3   (left; yellow line to input contact on the left) 
  - Unit trace L/D4 R/P4      (left; blue line on the left; prepares blue jumper to the right)
  - Unit trace L/D6 R/P6      (left; orange left line; to input contact on the left)

  
  - trace L/I5->J5  R/U5->V5  (right; trace to green output contact)
  - Unit trace L/I6 R/U6      (right; yellow right line; bridges IC to pullup)
