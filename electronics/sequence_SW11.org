  - black jumpers 1+1, all different
  - yellow 1+1, equal
  - orange 1+1 (maybe a trace)


- Under
  - trace L/C8->D8 R/O8->P8   (left; yellow line to input contact on the left) 
  - Unit trace L/D7 R/P7      (left; blue line on the left; prepares blue jumper to the right)
  - Unit trace L/D5 R/P5      (left; orange left line; to input contact on the left)

  
  - trace L/I6->J6  R/U6->V6  (right; trace to green output contact)
  - Unit trace L/I5 R/U5      (right; yellow right line; bridges IC to pullup)
